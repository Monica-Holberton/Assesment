# Assesment
Description:
This project demonstrates the creation and manipulation of singly and doubly linked lists in the C programming language. Each task is implemented in a separate program with its own main.c and related function files.

The goal is to practice building dynamic data structures and apply concepts like pointers, memory allocation, and traversal algorithms.
